<h2>Setup and Installation Requirements</h2>

<p>
This is a simple HTML5-based site with links and pictures, spanning two HTML files with links to external websites (external sites requirements are not detailed here). I have a relationship with Epicodus being a student of theirs, and nytimes.com as a paying subscriber. I have no other formal relationship with any of the other external websites.

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
